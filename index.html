									<p>Muggle or the smartest Wizard In Hogwarts?You Decide. At the outset, she is an annoying perfectionist, a goody-two-shoes who has read all the books for her classes in advance, has learned all about Hogwarts, and never breaks the rules. When she first speaks to Harry on the train ride to school, she is eager to impress him with her knowledge, whereas Harry only wants to make friendswhen Harry and Ron are reprimanded for trying to save her from the monster and she coolly delivers a bold-faced lie to the teacher. The little girl who has been abiding by all the school rules now dares to lie to her superiors, and a new friendship is born .Creating THE LEGENDARY TRIO</p>

									<h2 class="major">The Legendary Trio!</h2>
									<p>The friendship in Harry, Ron and Hermione[the legendary Trio]. The end of Voldemort demonstrated the tremendous depth of the friendship between the three of them, as Ron and Hermione both vowed to go with Harry wherever his journey may take him. Ron says, “We’re with you whatever happens,”  without having to ask Hermione, showing that the three of them have an understanding between them. Hermione’s remark that, “there was time to turn back if we wanted to. We’ve had time, haven’t we?” echoes back to the days, reminding us of everything that these three have faced together</p>

									<h2 class="major"> Lord Voldemort!</h2>
									<p> Voldemort aka Tom Riddle dedicated his life to the Dark Arts, world domination in the form of a wizard-centric pureblooded society, and the pursuit of immortality. The quest for immortality led Voldemort to create Horcruxes, or objects that house parts of his soul, since he cannot truly die while the Horcruxes exist. Though Voldemort always intended to make seven, he incorrectly believes that he only made six—Harry is the unknown final Horcrux, but having his soul split so many ways means that Voldemort's soul is too fragile for him to recognize this. A person must kill in order to make a Horcrux, and Voldemort in his cruelty has no problem with this. He's known as the most evil wizard in history and kills people for any reason, or no reason at all. </p>
